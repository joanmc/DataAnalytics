    "- The availability of public green spaces and pitches is available from some county and city councils - this is useful for use but as we were dealing with smaller areas - Garda Subdivisions - we needed to break the county/city council count of green space availability down into a count for these smaller areas\n",
    "- Furthermore, not all city/county councils provide the availability of green space in a format that we can readily use\n",
    "- the following data was available from each of the county/city councils listed:\n",
    "    - Fingal County Council - csv of public pitches\n",
    "    - Dublin City Council - a map with markers of public pitches and parks\n",
    "         - the positions of the markers were obtained from the network panal and saved to json files\n",
    "    - Dun Laoghaire County Council -  csv's - public parks and pitches\n",

    "- Galway and Roscommon green counts were also avaailable and taken as additional data, incase it was required at a later stage in the analysis\n",
